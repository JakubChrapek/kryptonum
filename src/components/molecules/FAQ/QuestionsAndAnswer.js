        question="How does the internet work?"
        answer="As every house, a website is located in a 
        specific location – this is your www (domain), thanks 
        to which others will be able to find you. The plot on 
        which the house is built is the server – it is a place 
        where the data is stored. You also need water & electricity 
        connections, right? Hosting is literally just that. It is necessary 
        for your house to be functional. Just as you pay for your water and 
        electricity, you need to provide a small payment for hosting 
        regularly, however, thanks to that, your website will become 
        functional in the internet."
